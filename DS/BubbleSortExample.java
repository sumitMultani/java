/*Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
 *  This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent
 *   elements is compared and the elements are swapped 
 *   if they are not in order. 
 *   This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as 
 *   its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.*/
