/*Quicksort is a fast, recursive, non-stable sort algorithm which works by the divide and conquer principle. 
 * 
 * Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays.
 *A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, 
 *based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.

 *Quick sort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays.
 *This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2),
 *where n is the number of items.
