/*Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. 
 * This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts,
 *the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. 
 *Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
 *
 *The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element,
 *and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element
 *to the right.
 *
 *This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n2),
 *where n is the number of items.
